                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 m 
                        (2 ft 11 in to 4 ft 11 in), and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85 cm (25.0 to 33.5 in). Females, at 45 to 75 kg (99 to 165 lb), 
                        are smaller and lighter than males, at 60 to 150 kg (130 to 330 lb).</p>
                    <p>A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. 
                        The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair 
                        every time the mouth is opened and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5 cm (10.0 in) long and have
                        a wide elliptical cross section, being about 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 2.5 cm (0.98 in) wide.</p>
                    <p>Its diet is omnivorous, composed of grasses, roots, berries and other fruits, bark, fungi, insects,
                        eggs and carrion. The diet is seasonably variable, depending on availability of different food items.
                        During the wet seasons, warthogs graze on short perennial grasses. During the dry seasons, they subsist on bulbs, 
                        rhizomes, and nutritious roots.</p>
