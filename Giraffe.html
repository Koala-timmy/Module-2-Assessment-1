                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14–19 ft) tall, with males taller than females.
                        The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female. 
                        Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short.The skin is mostly gray, or tan, and can reach
                        a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in).The 80–100 cm (31–39 in) long tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects</p>
                    <p>The coat has dark blotches or patches, which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black, surrounded by light hair, usually white or cream coloured.
                        Male giraffes become darker as they grow old. The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of 
                        savannah woodlands. When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move
                        about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which may be more 
                        important for calves. Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera Commiphora and Terminalia,
                        which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate. They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit.
                        A giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of plant matter daily. When stressed, giraffes may chew on large branches, stripping them of bark.</p>
