                    <h3>Koala</h3>
                    <p>The koala is a robust animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail. It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) 
                        and a weight of 4–15 kg (9–33 lb), making it among the largest arboreal marsupials. Koalas from Victoria are twice as 
                        heavy as those from Queensland. The species is sexually dimorphic, with males 50% larger than females. Males are further 
                        distinguished from females by their more curved noses and the presence of chest glands, which are visible as bald patches. 
                        The female's pouch opening is secured by a sphincter which holds the young in.</p>
                    <p>The pelage of the koala is denser on the back. The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown.
                        The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is mottled whitish and dark. The koala has the most effective insulating 
                        back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation.
                        The koala's curved, sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees. The large forepaws have two opposable digits 
                        (the first and second, which are opposable to the other three) that allow them to grip small branches.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are herbivorous, and while most of their diet consists of eucalypt leaves, they can be found in trees 
                        of other genera, such as Acacia, Allocasuarina, Callitris, Leptospermum, and Melaleuca.
                        Though the foliage of over 600 species of Eucalyptus is available, the koala shows a strong preference for 
                        around 30. They prefer plant matter with higher protein over fibre and lignin. The most favoured species are Eucalyptus microcorys, 
                        E. tereticornis, and E. camaldulensis, which, on average, make up more than 20% of their diet.</p>
