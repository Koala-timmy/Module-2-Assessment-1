                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                    <p>The tiger has a typical felid morphology. It has a muscular body with strong forelimbs, a 
                        large head and a tail that is about half the length of the rest of its body. There are five 
                        digits on the front feet and four on the back, all of which have retractable claws which are 
                        compact and curved. The ears are rounded, while the eyes have a round pupil.</p>
                    <p>Tiger fur tends to be short, except in the northern-living Siberian tiger. It has a mane-like 
                        heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. Its colouration 
                        is generally orange, but can vary from light yellow to dark red. White fur covers the ventral surface, 
                        along with parts of the face. It also has a prominent white spot on the back of their ears which 
                        are surrounded by black. The tiger is marked with distinctive black or dark brown stripes; the patterns 
                        of which are unique in each individual.</p>
                    <p>The tiger is a carnivore and an apex predator. It feeds mainly on ungulates, with a particular preference for sambar deer, 
                        Manchurian wapiti, barasingha and wild boar. Tigers will kill larger prey like gaur, but opportunistically eat 
                        much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, porcupines and fish.Tiger attacks on 
                        adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros have also been reported.</p>
