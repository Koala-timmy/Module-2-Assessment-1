                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; 
                        males have broader heads. The fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, 
                        and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, 
                        which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts.</p>
                    <p>The white lion is a rare morph with a genetic condition called leucism, which is caused by a double 
                        recessive allele. It is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lions have occasionally 
                        been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern 
                        South Africa. </p>
                    <p> Its prey consists mainly of ungulates particularly blue wildebeest, plains zebra, African buffalo, common warthog, 
                        gemsbok and giraffe. In India, chital and sambar deer are the most common wild prey, while livestock contributes 
                        significantly to lion kills outside protected areas. They usually avoid fully grown adult elephants, rhinoceroses 
                        and hippopotamus and small prey like dik-dik, hyraxes, hares and monkeys.</p>
