                    <h3>Gorilla</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, 
                        and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a 
                        silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. 
                        Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.</p>
                    <p>The eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. 
                        The mountain gorilla also has the thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla can be brown or greyish with a reddish forehead. 
                        In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern
                        gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla. Like humans, gorillas have individual fingerprints.</p>
                    <p>Leaves and pith are commonly eaten, but fruits can make up as much as 25% of their diets. Since fruit is less available, lowland 
                        gorillas must travel farther each day, and their home ranges vary from 2.7 to 6.5 km2 (1.0 to 2.5 sq mi), with day ranges 154–2,280 m (0.096–1.417 mi). 
                        Eastern lowland gorillas will also eat insects, preferably ants. Western lowland gorillas depend on fruits more than the others and they 
                        are more dispersed across their range. They travel even farther than the other gorilla subspecies, at 1,105 m (0.687 mi) per day on average, 
                        and have larger home ranges of 7–14 km2 (2.7–5.4 sq mi).</p>
