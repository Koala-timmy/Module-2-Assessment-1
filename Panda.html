                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 metres long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm and 60 to 90 cm 
                        tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to 160 kg. Females (generally 10–20% smaller than males)
                        can weigh as little as 70 kg (150 lb), but can also weigh up to 125 kg. The average weight for adults is 100 to 115 kg</p>
                    <p>The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, limbs and shoulders. The rest of 
                        the animal's coat is white. The bear's distinctive coat appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments. 
                        The white areas may serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs provide crypsis in shade. Studies in the wild 
                        have found that when viewed from a distance, the panda displays disruptive coloration while close up, they rely more on blending in.</p>
                    <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting 
                        almost exclusively of bamboo. However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as 
                        carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo.</p>
